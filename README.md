#### One of five provided architectures (code in architectures.py) can be chosen:
- fully connected neural network (build_fully_connected_NN)
- convoluational neural network (CNN) (build_CNN)
- recurrent neural network (RNN) (build_LSTM)
- CNN into RNN (build_CNN_LSTM)
- RNN into CNN into RNN (build_LSTM_CNN_LSTM) 





#### Class_weights for training are set to compensate for different amounts of TSS and background data for training. This can be modified in line 158
